# Questions

## How did you approach solving the problem?

I focused on the .NET implementation, creating a `FileDownloader` class responsible for handling the download logic. The core approach involved:
* **Abstraction:** Using interfaces (`IFileDownloader`, `IWebSystemCalls`) for network operations and the downloader itself to allow for mocking and testing.
* **Resilience:** Implementing a retry mechanism (`ExecuteWithRetryAsync`) with exponential backoff for handling transient network errors and disconnections. Based on the requirement for resilience to disconnections of "any length (from a couple of seconds to over two minutes)", the default finite retry parameters were significantly increased (`DefaultMaxRetries = 15`, `DefaultMaxRetryDelay = 60s`) to ensure the downloader could survive outages considerably longer than two minutes (~10 minutes total retry delay) before giving up.
* **Partial Downloads:** Checking the `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header to determine server support. If supported, the download proceeds in chunks, and importantly, it checks for existing partially downloaded files and resumes from the correct byte offset.
* **Full Downloads:** Implementing a fallback method to download the entire file in one go if partial downloads are not supported or if a full restart is deemed necessary (e.g., existing file size mismatch).
* **Integrity:** Retrieving the `Content-MD5` hash from the headers and verifying the downloaded file against it using `VerifyIntegrityAsync`. The file is deleted if the check fails, as per requirements.
* **Progress Reporting:** Implementing a callback mechanism (`Action<FileProgress>`) for progress updates. To improve clarity and testability, the console presentation logic (including state for reducing noise) was extracted into a dedicated `ConsoleProgressReporter` class. This class now handles formatting the output and only reports changes on whole percentage increments.
* **Cancellation:** Accepting and propagating a `CancellationToken` throughout the asynchronous operations to allow the download to be cancelled gracefully.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilizing `async`/`await` extensively for non-blocking I/O operations.

## How did you verify your solution works correctly?

Verification involved multiple layers:
* **Unit Testing:** Extensive unit tests were written using NUnit and Moq (`Tests.cs`, `ConsoleProgressReporterTests.cs`). These tests cover:
    * Header fetching success and failures (including retries).
    * Detection of partial vs. full download support.
    * Successful full and partial downloads.
    * Resuming partial downloads correctly.
    * Handling of network errors and timeouts during downloads (both full and partial chunks), verifying the extended retry logic (up to the configured limit).
    * MD5 integrity check success and failure (including file deletion on mismatch).
    * Cancellation during various stages of the download.
    * The logic of the extracted `ConsoleProgressReporter`, ensuring correct formatting and noise reduction (reporting only whole percentage changes).
* **Manual Testing (Simulated Disconnections):** As suggested in the README, I manually tested the compiled application by:
    * Using a network throttling tool (like NetLimiter) to slow down the download, providing time to intervene.
    * Manually disabling/enabling the network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) to simulate disconnections, specifically testing recovery after ~2 second and ~2 minute outages. The adjusted retry parameters allowed the application to successfully survive the 2-minute test.
    * Observing the console output to confirm that the application retried, didn't terminate, correctly reported errors (like DNS failures during disconnection), resumed progress upon reconnection, and completed successfully.
* **Code Review:** Analyzing the code for logical flow, error handling, adherence to requirements, readability, and structure (including the extracted progress reporter).

## How long did you spend on the exercise?

3-4 hours

## What would you add if you had more time and how?

* **Improve Logging:** Replace the current mix of `Console.WriteLine` in `FileDownloader` and the `ConsoleProgressReporter` with a structured logging framework (like Serilog or NLog). This would allow for consistent formatting with timestamps and log levels (Info, Warn, Error, Debug), writing logs to files or other sinks for easier diagnostics in a real-world scenario, and better control over verbosity (e.g., logging detailed progress only at Debug level).
* **Configuration for Retries:** Make the retry parameters (`maxRetries`, `initialRetryDelay`, `maxRetryDelay`) easily configurable when instantiating `FileDownloader`, rather than relying only on modifying the internal defaults. This could be done via constructor parameters or potentially an options object.
* **Refine `FileDownloader.cs` Structure:** While extracting the progress reporter helped, the main `TryDownloadFile` method could still potentially be broken down further into smaller, more focused private methods to enhance readability and isolation of different stages (e.g., header check, resume logic, dispatching to full/partial download, verification).
* **Complete Java Implementation:** Implement the downloader logic in the provided Java skeleton project, mirroring the approach and features of the .NET version.
* **Enhance Cancellation UX:** Modify the example console application (`Program.cs`) to demonstrate a more interactive user cancellation (e.g., "Press 'C' to cancel") rather than just relying on a command-line timeout argument.
* **Test Edge Cases:** Add more unit tests for specific edge cases, such as zero-byte files, network interruptions exactly *during* an MD5 calculation, or scenarios where server headers might change unexpectedly between requests (though less likely with HEAD followed by GET/Range).
